Using IMDB ratings data for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton, we will determine whether their ratings are the same or not. 

Null Hypothesis: IMDB mean rating is the same for SS and TB. difference in m =0

Alternative hypothesis: difference in mean is not equal to 0.
t-stat: difference between mean divided by standard error
p-value

```{r load-movies-data,fig.height=5, fig.width=8 }
movies <- read_csv( "/Users/siddharth/Downloads/movies.csv")
#glimpse(movies)

movies_2 <- movies %>% 
  group_by(director) %>% 
  filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg","Tim Burton")) %>% 
  summarise(rating,mean_rating = mean(rating), #find datapoints needed for t distribution.
         sd_rating = sd(rating),
         count=n(),
         t_critical =qt(0.975,count-1),
         se_rating = sd(rating)/sqrt(count),
         margin_of_error = t_critical*se_rating, 
         rating_low = mean_rating - margin_of_error, 
         rating_high = mean_rating +margin_of_error,
         highest_rating =max(rating),
         lowest_rating = min(rating))

#movies_mean<-count(movies, mean_rating) 
#movies_mean
movies_2

  ggplot(movies_2, aes(x = mean_rating,y = director))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(data = movies_2,aes(xmin = rating_low, xmax=rating_high,height=0.2), size = 1, height = 0.1)+
  labs(x = "Mean IMDB Rating",title = "Do Spielburg and Burton have the same mean IMDB rating",subtitle="95% confidence interval overlap")+

## Analysis

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=8}
t.test(rating~director, data = movies_2) #find t-stat, p-value

#simulating a null world using infer()
set.seed(1234)
ratings_in_null_world <- movies_2 %>%
  specify(rating~director) %>% # we want to look at ratings of directors
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%  # hypothesize that the difference is 0
  generate(reps=1000, type="permute") %>% # create a bunch of simulated samples
  calculate(stat="diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg","Tim Burton")) # find difference in means of each sample. 

#ratings_in_null_world visualize, with shaded p value
ratings_in_null_world %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = 0.64, direction = "two-sided")

 # finding p-value of simulated distribution
p_value <- ratings_in_null_world%>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = .64, direction = "two-sided")
p_value

```
With a p-value of 1%<5%, we can reject the null hypothesis that Spielburg and Burton have the same mean rating.  
You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

By using the infer package, we can simulate from a null distribution and compute p-values (with get_p_value()). As seen from above, the p-value from the null distribution gives 0.4%<1%<5%. Thus, we can  infer that the null hypothesis can be rejected.

We can conclude that the difference in mean ratings for the two directors is unlikely to be zero.
