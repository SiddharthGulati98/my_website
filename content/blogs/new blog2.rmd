# Climate change and temperature anomalies

We can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the
Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space
Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of
temperature anomalies can be found
here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)



```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```




```{r tidyweather}
#inspecting data.frame 'weather'

#glimpse(weather) 

# selecting the year and 12 month variables
weather_clean <- weather %>% 
  select(1:13) 

# converting to the dataframe to longer format (tidyweather)
tidyweather <- pivot_longer(weather_clean, cols = 2:13, names_to = "Month", values_to = "delta")

tidyweather
```

## Plotting Information

We plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a
trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called
`date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot
chronologically.


```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

## Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months?
Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month,
again with a smoothing line.




```{r facet_wrap}
ggplot(tidyweather) +
  aes(x = date, y = delta) +
  geom_point () +
  geom_smooth (color = "red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (title = "Weather Changes by Month") +
  facet_wrap(~ month)
```
-   Delta on the y-axis, represents the temperature deviations from the
    expected value. The red smooth lines we drew are the trend lines for
    the temperature changes. The steeper the smooth lines are, the
    higher the rates of temperature increases.
    
-   Before 1950, visually, we can see that for Januarys and Februaries,
    the effect of increasing temperature was more pronounced. For
    instance, the smooth line drawn for January is much steeper than
    that of July and August.
    
-   We can tell that the year 1950 was roughly a point, after which, the
    smooth line becomes much steeper for all months compared to
    before 1950. There are months where the effect of increasing
    temperature was more pronounced, but these effects are not
    distinctive visually.


## Removed Data before 1880
It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to
study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as
1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calcuialtes
a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base periof of 1951-1980.
The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups
data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010
and 2011-present.

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the
`mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains
information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign
the different periods using `case_when()`.

```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```


Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot
to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by
the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to
`interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot}
ggplot(comparison) +
  aes(x = delta, fill = interval) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 18)


```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might
be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using
`group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display
the result.

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
# creating summaries for mean delta 
# use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(mean_delta = mean(delta), na.rm = TRUE) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly) +
  aes(x = Year, y = mean_delta) +
  geom_point() +
  
  
#Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
#change theme to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  aes(x = Year, y = mean_delta) +
  geom_smooth(method = loess, color = "red") +
  theme_bw( base_size = 18) +
  labs (title = "Average Annual Anomolies Over Time", x = "Year", y = "Average Annual Temperature Change") 

```

## Confidence Interval for `delta`
### Using the formula

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

# choose the interval 2011-present
# what dplyr verb will you use? 
  formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
  filter(interval == "2011-present") %>% 
  
# calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta) 
# calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
# what dplyr verb will you use
    summarise(mean = mean(delta, na.rm = TRUE),
            count = n(),
            SD = sd(delta, na.rm = TRUE),
            SE = SD / sqrt(count),
            # find t critical value with n-1 degrees of freedom
            t_critical = qt(0.975,count -1),
            margin_of_error = SE * t_critical,
            lower_95pct_CI = mean - margin_of_error,
            upper_95pct_CI = mean + margin_of_error)
  
# print out formula_CI
formula_ci
```


### Using Infer() package
```{r CI_infer}
# calculate ci using the infer package (bootstrap simulation)
set.seed(1234)
boot_ci <- comparison %>% 
  # select the interval of interest
  filter(interval == "2011-present") %>% 
  # specify the variable of interest
  specify (response = delta) %>% 
  # generate bootstrap samples 
  generate (reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  # find mean
  calculate(stat = "mean") %>% 
  # find the ci
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")

# print out boot_ci
boot_ci
```
* We are 95% confident that the average temperature change in the 2011-present time period is between 1.02 and 1.11 degree-celcius.
* We get very similar results for confidence intervals from the bootstrap method as well as the formula method.
